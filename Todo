TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

# Bugs

# High priority

- check if CPAN::Reporter has tested before starting tests for a dist
- bring in CPAN::Reporter t/*.t support to actually test
- create a minicpan in the t/ directory for testing

# Medium priority

- prompt to continue or halt if CPAN sub process halts with signal
- write real documentation
- check recent files as well to pick up new developer versions
- break out of test loop and recheck for updates after some period of delay

# Low/Maybe

- clear CPAN build files (or patch CPAN) instead of running in a subshell (?)
