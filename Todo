TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

# Bugs

# High priority

- check if CPAN::Reporter has tested before starting tests for a dist
    - check last report found ?!?
    
- bring in CPAN::Reporter t/*.t support to actually test
- create a minicpan in the t/ directory for testing

# Medium priority

- write real documentation
- check recent files as well to pick up new developer versions
- break out of test loop and recheck for updates after some period of delay

# Low/Maybe

- find a way to clear CPAN programmatically instead of running in a subshell
  or else find a way to patch CPAN's set_perl5lib to restrict to only
  the necessary distributions
